# Changelog

## 2026-08-11 — Reuse-first Neon hardening candidate

- Preserved the existing public funnel, black-diamond visual system, canonical
  capture function, scoring/routing engine, notification outbox, and Lead Center.
- Moved SLA sweep, rate limiting, health safety, and server analytics off stale
  Supabase/Upstash assumptions and onto canonical Neon PostgreSQL.
- Added exact-origin, body-size, message-size, rate-limit, and timeout controls to
  public AI chat without changing the visible Ask Mike workflow.
- Added a disabled signed Gravity Forms bridge for exact form IDs 1–7 with HMAC,
  idempotency, bounded retry, and no duplicate WordPress email engine.
- Patched production dependencies and pinned the supported Node 20 runtime.
- Added full-history secret scanning, provider-neutral preview mutation guards,
  Edge-safe admin secret comparison, regression tests, browser E2E corrections,
  and rendered visual evidence.
