# Production Release and Go-Live Runbook

Updated 2026-08-19. The public funnel is live. Use this runbook for incremental,
reversible releases and controlled owned-traffic activation.

## Before merge

1. Fetch current `origin/main`; use an isolated worktree and preserve unrelated
   user or agent changes.
2. Record PR, immutable head commit, Vercel project, Preview deployment, current
   Production deployment, and rollback deployment.
3. Run the Node 24 release gate and confirm the Vercel Preview is Ready.
4. Verify changed routes in the protected Preview. Separate build, DOM/runtime,
   screenshot, database, provider-delivery, and physical-device evidence.
5. Classify migrations, environment changes, sends, WordPress publication, DNS,
   and external marketing as separate state changes.
6. Present the release-specific Production gate from the PR. Do not reuse a gate.

## Merge and deploy

1. Merge only the approved clean PR into `main` using the repository ruleset.
2. Let the canonical Git integration deploy the resulting `main` commit to the
   single owned Vercel project. Do not deploy from a different repository or
   attach Ask Magic Mike domains to another project.
3. Wait for Ready and confirm both custom aliases resolve to the approved
   deployment. Do not promote an artifact built from a different commit.
4. If an additive Neon Production migration is part of the release, use its own
   exact approval, pre/post assertions, transaction boundary, and forward-fix
   plan. A code approval alone is insufficient.

## Immediate verification

Run the repository health, funnel, route, release, and isolation verifiers. At a
minimum confirm:

- `/`, `/ask`, `/sell`, `/value`, `/home-value`, `/buy`, `/rent`,
  `/open-house/<approved-id>`, `/widget/v1`, `/privacy`, `/terms`,
  `/accessibility`, `/contact`, `/robots.txt`, and `/sitemap.xml`;
- apex 308 redirect and canonical metadata;
- live/readiness health with canonical Neon;
- anonymous `/admin` redirect to `/lead-center-login` and authorized RBAC access;
- no NellySelly hostname, project, database, variable, or content crossover; and
- no error-level regression in the observed Vercel window.

## Lead or messaging release verification

When the change touches capture, routing, email, push, SMS, or sequences:

1. Use a synthetic record marked `is_test=true` and
   `INTERNAL QA — DO NOT CONTACT` only after the exact QA-send/mutation approval.
2. Submit through the public form, not directly into the database.
3. Prove one canonical lead, attribution/consent, deterministic score/routing,
   one idempotent notification set, Lead Center visibility, and KPI exclusion.
4. For real provider tests, prove provider message ID and final delivery or
   failure/retry state. A 200 or queued state is not delivery proof.
5. Never contact a genuine WordPress-only entry whose purpose or consent is
   unclear; preserve it for BIC review.

## Phase 9 cumulative release sequence

Release only one approved PR at a time and verify Production before advancing:

1. `#178` — canonical operations documentation and fail-closed Preview QA;
2. `#177` — commercial-email compliance rendering;
3. `#170` — protected owned-demand command;
4. `#173` — device-private recurring review planner; and
5. `#172` — rebuild the database-revival command on the resulting baseline,
   preserving read-only behavior and requiring a fresh immutable release gate.

Each item retains its own exact approval phrase. Refresh any downstream branch
after the preceding Production merge, rerun Node 24 CI and Vercel Preview, and do
not treat this ordering as authorization to merge, deploy, publish, send, or
mutate data.

## Owned-traffic activation

After the lead path and exact publication gate pass, activate one reversible
placement at a time: canonical Our Town CTA, then approved page-specific widget,
then tagged GBP/social/email assets. Monitor conversion, source attribution,
duplicate rate, notification failures, and response SLA before expanding.
Paid traffic and carrier SMS remain separate approvals.

## Rollback

- Code: restore the recorded prior Vercel deployment/alias; verify health and
  canonical routes.
- WordPress: disable only the changed placement/form ID and restore its proven
  prior notification behavior without deleting entries.
- Messaging: pause only the affected channel/processor; preserve lead and outbox
  records for reconciliation.
- RBAC: revoke affected sessions first. Disable the feature only under the
  reviewed break-glass procedure; retain identity/audit tables.
- Database: prefer a forward fix. Never delete or drop canonical lead, consent,
  notification, audit, identity, or session data as an application rollback.

Record the outcome in `PRODUCTION_CHANGE_LOG.md`, including anything not proven.
