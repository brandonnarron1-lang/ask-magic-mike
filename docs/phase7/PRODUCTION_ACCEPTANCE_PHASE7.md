# Production acceptance — Phase 7

Release acceptance is evidence-based. Code-complete does not mean Production-verified.

Required proof: merged commit, Ready Vercel deployment, canonical domains unchanged, additive migration recorded, consumer/SMS/scheduler/AI-auto flags off, health/ready 200, funnel smoke, Lead Center RBAC, permission matrix, template previews, sequence draft safety, signed webhook, OpenAI provider or transparent deterministic fallback, no Vercel runtime errors, Brandon-only QA outbox/message ID/inbox receipt, and no Mike/consumer delivery.

Until those checks are complete, the release remains a candidate.
